            <h2> Community and Staff </h2>
            <ul class="rules">
                <li> Be respectful to everyone. This may be a server made for fighting, but have some honor and
                respect. Everytones here to have a good time, including you!</li>
                <li> Be respectful to staff and moderators, especially since they do have the power to ban you from
                servers or even the site. They're there to make sure everything is running properly and everyong is having
                fun, not to harrass and annoy when you're bored. </li>
                <li> Speaking of which, if you caught breaking rules you may be punished by suspension or even
                ban. Suspensions are temporary, bans are forever. All staff have the authority to issue punishments to
                a certain extent and have the authority to stop you to talk to you and ask questions. If you disobey lower 
                authority staff, punishments may become more severe.  </li>
                <li> In any case where you feel as if a staff member is treating you unfairly or is being direspectful,
                please report them to another staff member and they will take the steps neccesary to see that the
                incident is looked into. If they do not, continue to report until you grab another staffs attention.</li>
                <li> On the same note,  if you feel as if you have been unfairly punshed you can ask a staff to get
                a manager to review it when they have the time. However, bans and suspensions would be hard to reverse as
                staff should only issue those punishments when they are sure its necessary. </li>
                <li> Staff are there to help, but they may not always be readily available or able to assist you at 
                moments notice, so please be patient with them and try to avoid spamming them as it could result in
                a punishment. They're tyring their best and will get to you eventually! :) </li>
                <li> With all these rules around the staff and their role, authority, and what they do here, please
                do not be afraid to conversate and talk with staff as all staff should be friendly and polite, mostly because
                they have to reason not to be! If they aren't, you may report them as mentioned before.Staff should
                not be seen as someone to be afraid of but more as someone who keeps the server at its best.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Servers and Cheating </h2>
            <ul class="rules">
                <li> To make this very simple, CHEATING, MODDING, HACKING, OR ANYTHING THAT GIVES YOU AN ADVANTAGE
                OVER OTHER PLAYERS WILL RESULT IN IMMIDIATE BANS. We are making this a very strict 0 tolerance
                poicy. </li>
                <li> If you believe someone is cheating, please report them to staff and they will look into it
                further. If the staff memeber decides that player is cheating he will take proper action, 
                if not he will let you know and will not persue any further. You may not report someone after
                a staff member has looked into them more than once for you. 
                <li> You may be banned from seperate servers, a game server in general (for example you may not
                be able to play Minecraft on any of our servers), or from the site which in turn would mean from all
                game servers. If you are banned, the staff member you are dealing with should make your ban is clear
                to you and why you are being banned. If you are suspended they should tell you for how long and why. </li>
                <li> By playing on our servers, you are agreeing that you have not only read but will
